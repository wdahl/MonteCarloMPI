# MonteCarloMPI
Distributed implementation of Monte Carlo Simulations to estemate the value of pi

## Compile 
To complie the code run the make file in the terminal:
```bash
make
```

## Homework_7_distibuted.c
Performs monte carlo simulations to estimate the value of PI distributed over multiple nodes
Takes in 1 command line argument which in the number of random points to gernerate
```bash
./Homework_7_distributed [number of points]
```

## Homework_7_serial.c
Performs monte carlo simulations to estimate the value of PI
```bash
./Homework_7_serial.c [number of points]
```

## Output
The estemated value of PI after the simulations are run
